# cpp_smart_pointer_list
C++ example fo a smart pointer list

This simple program shows the use of the smart pointers that are available in the STL <memory> include.
It shows how to save smart pointers in a list and create "dynamically" more smart pointer objects, e.g. if you want
to create a tree.

Comments are desired...
